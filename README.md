# TS Simple Starter

A simple CLI to start your TS project with minimal configuration.

Basic configuration includes:

1. TS
2. Eslint + Prettier
3. Jest
4. Path Aliases

#### Get Started Immediately

You don't need to install or configure tools like TS version, ESlint, Prettier and Path aliases.
<br>
They are preconfigured and you can change anything you want (TS version, ESlint version, anything).

Just run the command, and you're good to go.

## Quick Overview

```
npx ts-simple-starter my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

### Running tests

```
npm run test
```

## Path aliases

You can simple import everything that is inside `src/` or `tests/` just using `import anything from '@/any-folder'` or `import tests from '@/tests/any-folder'`
